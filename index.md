| [01_Acey_Ducey](01_Acey_Ducey/javascript/aceyducey.html) | This is a simulation of the Acey Ducey card game. In the game, the dealer (the computer) deals two cards face up. You have an option to bet or not to bet depending on whether you feel the next card dealt will have a value between the first two. |
| [02_Amazing](02_Amazing/javascript/amazing.html)         | This program will print out a different maze every time it is run and guarantees only one path through. You can choose the dimensions of the maze - i.e. the number of squares wide and long.                                                        |
| [03_Animal](03_Animal/javascript/animal.html)            | Unlike other computer games in which the computer picks a number or letter and you must guess what it is, in this game _you_ think of an animal and the _computer_ asks you questions and tries to guess the name of your animal.                    |
| [04_Awari](04_Awari/javascript/awari.html)               | Awari is an ancient African game played with seven sticks and thirty-six stones or beans laid out on a board.
